# Notes on bold, italics, and strikethroughs

If you want a **bold**, two asterisks, if you want *italics*, use one *.

You can also use underscores for the same effect. __Bold__ and _italics_ using _

If you want both, mix and match asterisks and underscores. _**Both**_

For strikethrough, ~use~ the wavy line ~
