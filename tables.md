# How to make tables
you can create table easiy with markdown (which this is)

| Name | Occupation | Favourite lolly
|:----|----:|:----:|
|Mary | my | table |
|Mary | my | table |
|Mary | my | table |

Table is a good lolly. The minuses signify that the row above is a header row. A table needs a header row to exist here. 

Some tips:
* Align columns using : . Aligns to whichever side the colon is on. If on both sides will be centred. 
* really the minus line is like a formatting line. The setting, maybe. 
* tables are not officially supported by markdown, because markdown is STUPID.
* so tables can vary across plaforms. E.g different to R studio. 
* so **use tables with caution**
* which is STUPID
