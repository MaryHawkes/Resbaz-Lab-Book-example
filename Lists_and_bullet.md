# How to make lists
Als note, always use underscores in the name so you don'thave to use the \(ignore space) button in the terminal

To create lists, begin a line with an asterisk, or minus
* Like this
* This
* This

- Or this
- This 
- This

Always converts to dots, not dashes. Make subpoints with two spaces at the front:
- This
  - This
  - This

If you want to creat numbered lists just type the number.
1. This
1. This
1. This
Doesn't matter if it's the right number, just so long as its a number and a dot and a space.
